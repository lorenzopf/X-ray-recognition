    X ray recognition is a Python project, the purpose is to recognize with x-ray picture of lungs if a patient could present a risk of Pneumonia. I developed a Machine learning model trained with many pictures to predict if a patient has pneumonia symptoms.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I did this project during two weeks in school. I chose this topic because it was during the COVID period (1st Lockdown) and I found the idea really innovative and useful to predict if a patient could be detected as sick or not just with X-ray picture and Datascience. The predictions are based on a great numbers of pictures, the Machine Learning model is trained and evaluated with clusters of pictures. Here the Illness is Pneumonia, so the X-ray pictures are only based on lungs.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first install Python Version 3.10
You will also need to install 'pip' ,  to install all the project dependencies

### Prerequisites

This is all the dependencies you need to install with pip
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install seaborn
  pip install callbacks
  pip install tensorflow
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the project and run the file x-ray.ipynb (Jupiter Notebook) you need a special environment who can read jupyter Notebooks.
I advise Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/)
